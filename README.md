# CardGame
This is a Windows Forms application, created using C#, in which the player should find all the pairs of cards as fast as possible. It has an implementation of data bases in which it stores the scores obtained by the players (the period of time needed to complete the game). A lower score means a better position in the ranking. This was developed as a proof of informatics competencies for the certificate in computer science from the final year of high school. It is a prototype and it has to be treated as such.
